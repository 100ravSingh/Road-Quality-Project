# Road-Quality-Project
### Objective: Road Quality web application introduces an impressive 88.90% accuracy rate in assessing asphalt road quality through advanced deep learning. As part of our commitment to excellence, we now offer support for batch operations, allowing users to upload entire folders of road images for simultaneous processing. After analysis, the application generates a comprehensive zip file containing two folders, "Good" and "Bad," categorizing images based on their quality assessment. Additionally, users receive a detailed PDF report accompanying the zip file. This report includes a table with columns such as Serial Number, File Name, and Assessment Result, providing a structured overview of the quality assessment for each processed image. Our user-friendly interface ensures a seamless experience for users managing multiple road quality assessments. We encourage continuous feedback from users to further refine and enhance the accuracy of our model, ensuring that our application remains at the forefront of asphalt road quality evaluation.
